PROMPT_GENERATE_PROPERTY_REPORT = """
 You are an expert in pharmaceutical chemistry, technology, and analytical chemistry. Your task is to generate a highly condensed, technical report focused solely on a specific physicochemical property of a given API, using only the essential details provided in the web research context.

Inputs:
1. Query that shows what is the specific physicochemical property of the given Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient to which the report must be written: <query>{query}</query>
2. A compiled web research context with references, links, content, and raw content related to that specific physicochemical property:
<property_research_context>
{property_research_context}
</property_research_context>

Instructions:
1. Identify the specific physicochemical property from the query.
2. Extract and synthesize only the most critical data points, numerical values, and technical findings directly related to that property from the provided context.
3. Generate a condensed report that includes only essential data analysis and technical details regarding the reported valur and/or information regarding that specific property. Do not include any introductory paragraphs, discussions of methodologies, or concluding remarks.
4. Integrate specific references and include URLs from the context where relevant.
5. Use precise pharmaceutical and chemical terminology throughout.

Output Format: Produce a plain text report with minimal structure—if needed, use brief headings such as "Data Analysis" or "Technical Details"—ensuring that the output is direct, concise, and devoid of any extraneous commentary.

Notes: 
• Exclude any background, introductory, or concluding text. 
• Focus exclusively on the key technical details and data extracted from the research context.
